# Fundamentals-Programming-I
Programs written during Fundamentals Programming - Python

This is first actual programming class I ever took, I was taking a engineering class at same time that had much more practice and often moved at a faster pace than this class. Both classes used Python.

Note: While this class did not require the use of Pycharm by JetBrains, my engineering class did. For simplicity during the semester I used pycharm for both classes. As such there may be a few programs that require downloading a library to them to function properly.
